Converts IEEE publications from HTML (save as in firefox), to epub files for ebook readers. The code requires the files/folders ['<name>.html', '<name>_files'] to exists. 
The code is very ugly, and just a hack so I can read IEEE papers on my kindle. 

Current version includes support for: 
 - Title
 - Authors
 - Text
 - Figures
 - Tables

Fix in later version: 
 - Appendix
 - More space-efficient (don't include useless images, like author bios)
 - References
 - Working links
